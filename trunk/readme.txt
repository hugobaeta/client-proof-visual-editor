Simple, option-less, plugin to make TinyMCE - the WordPress Visual Editor - easier for clients and n00bs.

== Description ==

Simple, option-less (yeah, that's a feature), plugin to make TinyMCE - the WordPress Visual Editor - easier for clients and n00bs. It removes a bunch of TinyMCE features that could potentially be used by inexperienced clients to screw-up the theme developers hard work! It also makes TinyMCE remove the nasty formatting when you paste content directly in it - so, there is no need to use the "paste from Word" or "paste from text" buttons! 

Thanks to [Jos&eacute; Fontainhas](http://ze.fontainhas.com/) for testing and SVN help and [Tiago Rodrigues](http://http://trodrigues.net/) for help with TinyMCE "paste" issues.
